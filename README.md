To my son, who I am dedicating this adventure to,

I hope you don't grow up thinking I work too much, but if you do, I hope I've taught you a few things.

1. I am not under the illusion I work more than necessary "for you." I work so much because, to me, this is a big piece of what it means to be a man, a husband, and a father.
1. The hard path is almost always the right path
1. You can do whatever you want as long as you don't get in someone else's way

## The goal

**Transition from a lead web frontend engineer into a role building and operating systems supporting real-world research or field operations.**

I want to maintain my role as a software engineer while expanding to hardware-adjacent and field-deployed systems - building data pipelines, edge services, and operational tooling for environments where reliability, observability, and on-site deployment matter.

Common names for this new role:

- RSE (research software engineer)*
- Scientific programmer
- Field systems engineer
- Data systems engineer
- Embedded systems engineer

*I will be referring to the position/role/industry I'm wanting to transition into as "RSE" for simplicity.

## The plan

Over the next three to five years, I'm going to teach myself the skills and gather the experience necessary to find a junior-to-mid-level RSE position.

As a self-taught frontend engineer, I've made the same mistake most self-taught engineers make - spending too much time "studying" instead of building things. However, there is a tremendous amount of foundational information I am aware I don't have which I absolutely need to understand, so I'll be reading and building concurrently. I will be intentionally avoid YouTube content, but I will be utilizing AI for learning and debugging.

As a new father, with another on the way, an intensive full-time job, three dogs, and a farm to manage, I can only dedicate one and a half to two hours every morning.

### Reading list

I do *intend* to read in the following order; however, I wouldn't usually put *Interview Design Patterns* and *Pheonix Project* at the top of the list, but I had already started *Interview Design Patterns*, and I hate not to finish what I start, and *Pheonix Project* is relevant to things going on at work right now.

I've included a personal reading list to serve as a break when needed between the highly technical reads. Ignore it if you don't care, but this is what I prefer to read in my freetime if not isekai novels.

*I will be utilizing audio books

#### Technical

1. Interview Design Patterns - common algorithms and interview prep
1. Pheonix Project - devops
1. Code: the Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software - first principles of how computers work
1. Computer Systems: a Programmer's Perspective - deep dive into a computer's systems
1. The Go Programming Language - my preferred, relevant "lower-level" language
1. Designing Data-Intensive Applications - scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability of data
1. System Design Interview - high-level system design of common, everyday systems
1. The Clean Coder - disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of software craftsmanship
1. Clean Architecture - impementation examples combining Clean Code and Clean Coder principles

#### Life/philosophical

1. Atomic habits
1. Beyond Order: 12 more rules for life
1. Wild at heart
1. Lions and scavengers

### Project list

Projects slowly progress from systems I've been wanting around my home which mostly consistent of integrating off-the-shelf systems to "full pipeline" projects implementing collection, storage, analysis, visualization, insights.

*Projects are subject to change; however, once a project is started, it will be finished.

*I'm going to buy a 3D printer this spring to expirement with making "hardware" for projects, such as cases, mounts, hooks, etc., and things around the farm, so any piece of a project I can make myself, I will attempt to do so.

1. NAS server
1. Plex server
1. Outdoor, point-to-point networking setup for my barns
1. 4K camera system for my property
1. Tablet-based home and family management system to manage chores, schedules, smart devices, equipment maintenance, weather reports, etc.
1. "Weather station" around my property to get real-time weather information (hardware to software)
1. 
1. Handheld radio
